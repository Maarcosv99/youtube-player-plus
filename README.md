## Features

*   üåê Utilizes the [YouTube IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference)
*   ‚ö°Ô∏è Offers an incredibly fast initial loading time
    *   Automatically loads the YouTube IFrame API `<script>` during first use
    *   For an even quicker start, include `<script src='https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api' defer></script>` in your webpage
    *   Ensures API `<script>` isn't loaded twice by detecting its presence
*   üöÄ API commands are smoothly queued up (wait until both IFrame API and Player instance are ready)
*   ‚ö†Ô∏è ¬†Distinguishes between serious errors and unplayable video issues
*   ‚è≤Ô∏è Incorporates the crucial 'timeupdate' event that YouTube API is missing
*   üí° Clear and detailed code comments for easy comprehension
*   üíØ Strongly typed.
*   üì¶ Does not rely on large dependencies or unnecessary code
